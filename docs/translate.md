_Step 4_ Add your translations

All of the strings on the webstie are auto-translated by default, so you should review the translations and correct them where appropriate. In this file you will see english comments along with the auto-translations. The enligh comments may not be up to date with the website so please compare the most recent (live) version of the website when translating strings.

You must ensure that the indentation remains the same; there are two spaces at the start of each line.

_Step 5_ Commit your changes

It's a good idea to commit your changes frequently to avoid losing progress. You can commit as many times as you like. Commit directly to your `babel` branch.
